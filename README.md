üåê Weather Dashboard ‚Äî Project Description

This project is a Weather Dashboard Web Application developed as part of the CodTech Internship Task-1. The goal of the project was to build a responsive webpage that integrates with a public API and displays data dynamically. The chosen public API is Open-Meteo, a free weather API that provides current and forecast weather information without requiring an API key.

The project demonstrates how a front-end web application can interact with an external API to fetch real-time data and display it in a user-friendly interface.

üîπ Project Functionality

The Weather Dashboard allows users to:

Search for a City

The user enters the name of a city (e.g., Delhi, New York, Tokyo) into the search bar.

The application first uses the Open-Meteo Geocoding API to find the latitude and longitude of the city.

Fetch Weather Data

Once the coordinates are found, the application sends another request to the Open-Meteo Forecast API to get the current weather, hourly forecast, and detailed weather data.

Display Data Dynamically

The fetched data is displayed directly on the webpage:

Current temperature, weather condition, wind speed, pressure, and local time.

Hourly forecast for the next 12 hours in a card layout.

A detailed 24-hour weather table with temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

Responsive Design

The webpage is designed to adapt to different screen sizes, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

üîπ Technologies Used

1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

Provides the structure of the webpage.

Used for elements like the header, input box, button, weather cards, and table.

2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

Handles the design and layout.

Provides styling such as colors, fonts, margins, responsive grid layout, and button designs.

Makes the webpage visually appealing and user-friendly.

3. JavaScript (JS)

Adds interactivity and connects the webpage with the Open-Meteo API.

Uses the fetch() function to send API requests and process JSON responses.

Dynamically updates the HTML content (DOM manipulation) based on API data.

4. Open-Meteo API

A public weather API that provides free access to forecast and current weather data.

Two endpoints are used in this project:

Geocoding API ‚Üí To convert city name into latitude and longitude.

Forecast API ‚Üí To fetch weather data using those coordinates.

üîπ Importance of the Project

This project highlights the practical use of API Integration in web development. APIs act as a bridge between applications, allowing developers to use external data and services without building everything from scratch. By learning to integrate APIs, developers gain skills to work with real-world applications such as weather dashboards, news feeds, stock market trackers, and more.
